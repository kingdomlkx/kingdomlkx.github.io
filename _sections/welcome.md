This Jekyll theme lets you build as many of these sections as you want. They live in the _sections folder in your project's root directory. For some examples, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue). Just be sure to add some [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to each section.

All sections have titles, which are listed in the site's navigation menu. At the top of each section, the section's title will render by default (e.g., Welcome to Jekyll!). If you want it to show something different (see Intro), add **auto-header: none** to your frontmatter, and add your text in a <h2> tag inside a <header> tag outside the frontmatter. You'll want to give each section an **order** parameter, also in the frontmatter, or it won't know where to put itself and will hide. Icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

You may notice that this section is written in Markdown -- either Markdown or html works!

*这是我第一次作个人博客网站,虽然充满了实验性质,但还是灌输了不少心血.在这个过程中学到了不少东西,虽然大部分时间都在碰壁,都在百度.感受最深的就是,官方文档虽然说的最详细,最系统,但是....他默认你知道甚至精通很多东西.而百度可以解决一些问题,但你要有大浪淘沙的觉悟.*  
_虽然很累,但很有趣不是吗?_
